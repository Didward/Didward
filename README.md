<h1> Students Pay Attention! </h1>

"Did you know that if you are a student, you can apply for the Github student offers and claim a whole load of useful and life-changing tools such as a collection of paid Jetbrains IDE's for absolutely free and Github Copilot!"
<br> <br>
These are just <strong> a tiny fraction </strong> of what you really get! My jaw dropped at the moment I had access to IntelliJ Ultimate, Pycharm Professional, PhpStorm, DataSpell and way more in just the Jetbrains package (this all together costs thousands if not then hundreds of pounds/dollars!).
<br> <br>
Anyways, I just needed to share this with you! It was a complete life-changer. I am exceeding in my Computing related lessons after utilising this to my ability.
